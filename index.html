      <h1>Raymond Yang</h1>
      <hr />
      <p>Hi! My name is Raymond, and I'm a sophomore at Yale University pursuing a B.S. in <em>Computer Science</em> and <em>Statistics &amp; Data Science</em>. During my time at Yale, I hope to learn more about and work on projects related to machine learning and search. I love to work at the intersection of computer science and math &mdash; a recent <a href="https://github.com/abacles/fugue">project</a> combines Fourier Transforms, linear algebra, and music to create a note detection system.</p>

            Yale University Department of Music, <em>Software Developer</em>, summer 2021<br />
            Worked in a team to create a prototype of a sight-singing practice app for an introductory music class (MUSI 110) at Yale to display short segments of music in a custom notation designed to help students read music. Worked on the Flask backend to load the relevant audio and image files for each sight-singing exercise, created the user authentication system, and managed the server.

            Yale University School of Nursing, <em>Research Assistant</em>, fall 2020 to summer 2021<br />
            Used Python to speed up the data analysis process by generating code to process the entire dataset at once rather than by individual subjects. Automated the data cleaning process by creating several Python scripts to reformat data tables.

            SAS, <em>Summer Intern</em>, summer 2019<br />
            Collected 12,000 restaurant reviews from a Chinese Yelp-like website (<a href="https://dianping.com">dianping.com</a>) with Scrapy and used SAS Visual Text Analytics software to produce a report analyzing those reviews. Created SAS LITI rules to extract names of dishes from the reviews and analyze the sentiment of their contexts. Coauthored an article about this project for SAS WeChat.

            Tricorn Technology, <em>Summer Research Intern</em>, summer 2018<br />
            Built a retrieval-based Chinese chatbot prototype that uses Elasticsearch to select a few appropriate responses and a convolutional neural network to choose the best one from the candidates. Cleaned and reformatted a separate dataset of a combination of Wikipedia pages and Reddit threads. Used TF-IDF to match the most relevant sections of the Wikipedia pages to each Reddit conversation in the dataset.

            Note detection<br />
            Built a Fourier-Transform-based system (<a href="https://github.com/abacles/fugue">GitHub</a>, interactive demo on <a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/abacles/fugue/HEAD?labpath=demo.ipynb">Binder</a>) to detect musical notes from a melody and produce a visualization. Designed algorithms for detecting note onsets and mitigating the influence of noise in the Fourier Transforms.

            Pinyin labeling<br />
            Wrote a program that labels the pinyin pronunciation of Chinese characters. Created <a href="http://abacles.com/qi">pinyin-annotated versions</a> of eight novels by Jin Yong to make the text more accessible to learners of Chinese. The project was featured on <em>The World Journal</em>, the largest Chinese newspaper in the US.
