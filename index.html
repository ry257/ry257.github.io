      <hr />
      <p>Hi! My name is Raymond, and I'm a rising senior at Yale University pursuing a B.S. in <em>Computer Science</em> and <em>Statistics &amp; Data Science</em>. I love to work at the intersection of computer science and other fields &mdash; <a href="https://github.com/abacles/fugue">one of my favorite projects</a> combines Fourier Transforms, linear algebra, and music to create a note detection system.</p>

            <p>Citadel Securities (Miami, FL), <em>Software Engineering Intern</em>, summer 2023</p>
            <p>As part of the message bus team, contributed to a reliable, highly efficient, and customizable distributed publisher-subscriber system to support trading and research across the firm.</p>
            <p>Enabled the monitoring of publisher and subscriber liveness in the distributed message bus. Implemented a robust retry system that recovers from interruption of the gRPC heartbeats. Supports indirect maintenance of heartbeats via brokers to reduce load on the discovery backend.</p>
            <p>Captured and exposed the connectivity status between publishers and subscribers to reduce time needed to diagnose issues from 30+ minutes (of manually examining multiple logs) to seconds. Reports detailed, per-shard connection state between every pair of publisher and subscriber and records the latest state change event across multicast and TCP channels. Built a tool to construct connection graphs to visualize the system state. Designed a flexible data model for connectivity that supports different types of underlying transports.</p>

            <p>Spotnana Technology (Palo Alto, CA), <em>Software Engineering Intern</em>, summer 2022</p>
            <p>(Spotnana is rebuilding the infrastructure of the business travel industry and creating a consumer-grade booking app for business travelers, raising $75M in Series B funding last year.)</p>
            <p>Built the United Airlines supplier engine for the booking app to enable shopping, booking, and cancelling United flights directly via United's New Distribution Capability (NDC) API, eliminating the need to shop through a Global Distribution System (GDS) such as Sabre while driving down costs. Demonstrated the integration live to United Airlines representatives, passed their tests, and received their official approval to deploy to travelers at 50+ corporate clients. Pushed the project into production.</p>
            <p>Designed a cache to reduce the loading time of the trip details page, achieving a 3x speedup on a cache hit. The cache saves recent NDC requests and responses to avoid sending unnecessary network calls that fetch information about the same trip multiple times.</p>
            <p>Created a system to ensure itinerary data displayed in the app always stays up to date by detecting and reconciling changes to the booking made outside the app (such as flight delays and voluntary changes made by the passenger through outside channels). Deployed the system into production for American Airlines NDC travelers.</p>

            <p>Yale University Department of Music, <em>Software Developer</em>, summer 2021</p>
            <p>Worked in a team led by the Chair of the music department to build a sight-singing practice app which displays music in a custom notation designed to help students in MUSI 110 (an introductory music class at Yale) to read music. Led the development of the Flask backend to support track selection and user authentication. Managed the server and containerized the app for deployment. Created a system to generate audio to accompany the sight-singing exercises on the fly.</p>

            <p>Collected 12,000 restaurant reviews from a Chinese Yelp-like website (<a href="https://dianping.com">dianping.com</a>) with Scrapy and leveraged SAS Visual Text Analytics software to produce a report analyzing those reviews. Created SAS LITI rules to extract names of dishes from the reviews and analyze the sentiment of their contexts. Coauthored an article in a SAS blog about this project, receiving 2,000+ views from potential clients.</p>

            <p>Built a retrieval-based Chinese chatbot prototype that uses Elasticsearch to select the most relevant responses from a database. Trained a convolutional neural network to help select the most appropriate response from those candidates.</p>
            <p>Cleaned and reformatted a separate dataset consisting of Wikipedia pages and Reddit threads. Used TF-IDF and cosine similarity to match the most relevant sections of the Wikipedia pages to each Reddit conversation in the dataset.</p>

Added support for state persistence so that a rebooted server can resume replication from its most recent saved state. Implemented the fast log backtracking optimization described in the extended Raft paper.
